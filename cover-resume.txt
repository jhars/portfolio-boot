Flipboard
Position – QA Automation Engineer- Mobile | Engineering | Palo Alto, CA

Hi - I am a software-engineer and this is my portfolio website:
www.jonharlan.com

I develop web applications in a range of 6 modern programming languages: JavaScript, Swift, Ruby, Python, HTML5, CSS3. I am versed in in three “full-stacks”:

1.	MEAN
2.	Ruby on Rails
3.	Swift 2.0

I have a deep-level understanding of modern data-infrastructure, online-content editorial experience, and I am a clever problem solver. I also read Flipboard everyday. 

Right around the time I started a 12-week Web-Development Immersive Program (www.Generalassemb.ly) this summer, was when I switched over from Zite to Flipboard as my news app. I was initially impressed with the smart-category-suggestions and believe that the interface-templates, which Flipboard is developing, are first-class designs for the mobile web.

I am a great team member and feel that I could make an immediate contribution at Flipboard in this role. I am eager to apply a recently learned set of new development tools and develop as an engineer.

Thank you for your consideration.
