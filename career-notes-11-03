Customizable Team Helmet Stickers

Description:

I wanted to create a tool which allows users to customize design elements of real-world objects; giving the user enough freedom to create designs while limiting options/tools to create user-friendly interface.

After exploring 3-5 different ways to accomplish my vision, I decided to use HTML5 and Sprint Animations to re-create elements of factorycustom.com (helmet manufacturer). The first step was to dive as deep as I could into the DOM of factorycustom.com (explored their front-end code which is available to through Chrome Dev Tools). I was able to locate every single they used to build the site and, through this process, formed a detailed understanding of how customization platform was built.

Instead of setting up a green-screen and creating a precise photography process, I used images from factorycustom.com; which were perfectly formatted as well. The User-Interface displays available tools & colors in the top-left corner, a location which most internet-users are comfortable tinkering with(user-friendly location).

Technologies Used: HTML5 Canvas; CSS; Javascript; 

Responsibilities & Lessons Learned:

a) 360-- learning how it work using XY-Axis-Grid coordinates (similar to GPS) to track your mouse movement
d) Mouse (click) Events on a laptop differ from Touch Events on mobile devces in the code (HTML5)
b) Using images to create custom UX/UI involves careful coordination of images, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
